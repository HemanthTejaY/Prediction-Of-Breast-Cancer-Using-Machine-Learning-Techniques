# Prediction-Of-Breast-Cancer-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

Using this dataset of 32 variables measuring the size and shape of cell nuclei, goal is to create a model that will allow us 
to predict whether a breast cancer cell is benign or malignant.

Data Standards in cancer research have been evolving considerably.Technical Standards and data administration are the fundamental 
requirements of Diagnosis and Prognosis with enormous challenges. Cancer, a deadly disease can be analysed with the innumerable
genomic data and ethical analysis with big data functionalities as its crux. Breast Cancer Wisconsin data set from the UCI 
Machine learning repo is used to conduct the analysis.
We have implemented the following machine learning algorithms using R and Apache Spark:
 PCA
 Decision trees
 Linear regression
 The Random Forest Technique
 Logistic Regression
 Naive Bayes
 Extreme Gradient Boosting
Data is visualized by manual work. The limitations are that time taken for predicting tumour is high. The correct stage of the
breast cancer is not predicted completely accurately. The risk of prediction is high and data is not visualized properly.
